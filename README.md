# GeoDrops for Home Assistant

A native Home Assistant integration for [GeoDrops](https://geodrops.io/) soil
moisture probes. It reads your sensor data straight out of BigQuery and
exposes each probe as a Home Assistant device with 27 sensors — no MQTT
bridge, no external service to run, no YAML to hand-edit. Everything is
configured through the UI.

This is a companion project to the standalone
[`ha-geodrops-rachio-irrigation`](https://github.com/ajbaldwin/ha-geodrops-rachio-irrigation)
irrigation scheduler, but it does not require it — install this on its own if
all you want is soil-moisture data in Home Assistant.

## What it does

GeoDrops probes publish their readings to a BigQuery table
(`geodrops-prod.db_public.p_sensor_unified`) that GeoDrops has made publicly
readable. This integration polls that table directly from Home Assistant,
using the [aiogeodrops](https://github.com/ajbaldwin/aiogeodrops) library
over BigQuery's REST API, and turns the latest reading per probe into sensor
entities. There's no MQTT broker, no intermediate sync process,
and no polling service to keep alive outside of Home Assistant itself.

### Supported devices

Any GeoDrops soil probe that reports to GeoDrops' cloud, i.e. whose readings
appear in the GeoDrops app. The integration never talks to a probe directly,
so a probe that isn't uploading to GeoDrops can't be added. No other brand of
soil sensor is supported.

### Use cases

- **Smarter irrigation.** Skip or shorten a watering run when the soil is
  already moist, instead of relying on a fixed schedule or rain forecasts.
- **Plant and lawn care alerts.** Get notified when a bed dries out, or when
  soil temperature drops towards frost.
- **Probe upkeep.** Know when a probe's battery runs low or it stops
  reporting, before its readings go stale.

## Prerequisites

You need a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project of your own — this is where
your queries run and are billed, not where the data lives.

Follow the GeoDrops community walkthrough (with screenshots),
[Integrating GeoDrops soil moisture sensors with Home Assistant](https://geodrops.discourse.group/t/integrating-geodrops-soil-moisture-sensors-with-home-assistant/280#p-953-step-by-step-setup-5), or the
self-contained steps below. If that link ever moves, search the
[GeoDrops community](https://geodrops.discourse.group/) for "Home Assistant".

1. **Create (or reuse) a GCP project** at the
   [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) — e.g. `home-assistant-geodrops`.
   Note its **project ID** (you enter it during setup).
2. **Enable the BigQuery API** on that project: APIs & Services → Library →
   search "BigQuery API" → **Enable**.
3. **Create a service account**: IAM & Admin → Service Accounts →
   **Create service account** (e.g. `home-assistant-bigquery`).
4. **Grant it `BigQuery Job User`** (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`) **on your own
   project**. That is the only role required — it lets the account run query
   jobs billed to your project. *(The community guide also adds `BigQuery Data
   Viewer`; that's harmless but not required to read the public `db_public`
   dataset.)*
5. **Create and download a JSON key**: on the service account → Keys → Add key
   → Create new key → **JSON**.
6. **Paste the key's contents into the config flow** at setup (see
   *Configuration* below). Unlike the older MQTT bridge, this integration does
   **not** need the file placed in `/config`; Home Assistant stores it in its
   config entry. Then **delete the downloaded key file**.

**Keeping the key safe.** Home Assistant stores config entries unencrypted,
in `/config/.storage/core.config_entries`, and that file is included in
backups. Anyone who can read your configuration directory or a backup can use
the key. With only BigQuery Job User it can run queries billed to your
project and nothing else, so the risk is cost, not data. To cap that cost, set
a custom quota in the GCP Console: IAM & Admin → Quotas, BigQuery API,
*Query usage per day*. About 30 GiB matches BigQuery's free tier of 1 TiB a
month, which this integration stays well within (see
[Polling and cost](#polling-and-cost)). If a key may
have leaked, delete it on the service account's Keys tab and paste a new one
through **Reconfigure**.

You do **not** need to request access to GeoDrops' data or add any
reader/viewer grant on the `db_public` dataset — GeoDrops publishes it as a
public dataset, so any service account that can run a query job in its own
project can already read it. If a query ever fails with a permissions error
*after* your Job User role is confirmed, the cause is almost certainly on the
GeoDrops side (dataset sharing changed), not your IAM setup.

## Installation

1. In HACS, add this repository as a **custom repository** (category:
   Integration): `https://github.com/ajbaldwin/ha-geodrops-hacs`.

   This repository publishes releases with `hide_default_branch: true`, so
   HACS will only ever offer you tagged releases, never the tip of `main`.
2. Install **GeoDrops** from HACS, then restart Home Assistant
   when prompted.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**, search for
   **GeoDrops**, and start the config flow.

### Beta versions

New versions are released as betas (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`) before they become a
stable release. HACS only offers betas if you opt in:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Entities**, search for
   **Pre-release**, and open the one for *GeoDrops* (a switch HACS creates for
   each repository, disabled by default).
2. Enable the entity, wait about 30 seconds, then turn the switch **on**.

HACS then offers each beta as an update. Turn the switch off to go back to
stable releases only; you'll get the next stable when it's newer than the beta
you're on.

## Configuration

The config flow is two steps:

1. **Credentials.** Paste the full contents of your service-account JSON key
   into the "Service-account JSON" field, and enter your GCP **project id**
   (e.g. `your-gcp-project-id` — this is your own project from the
   prerequisites above, not GeoDrops'). Home Assistant validates the
   credentials by making a real BigQuery call before letting you continue.
2. **Add a probe.** Enter the probe's **serial number** exactly as shown in
   the GeoDrops app (e.g. `AAA111`) and a friendly name. The integration
   looks up recent readings for that serial to confirm it exists and has
   reported within the lookback window before adding it — if nothing turns
   up, you'll get an error instead of a silently-empty device. This lookup
   only validates the serial; it does not show a live reading preview.

After the first probe is added, you can add more, remove existing ones, or
tune polling/staleness settings at any time from the integration's
**Configure** options (Settings → Devices & Services → GeoDrops →
Configure). Adding another probe by serial works the same way as the initial
setup.

### Advanced Options

Configure → **Advanced Options** holds the polling and staleness settings.
Saving them reloads the integration.

| Option | Default | Allowed | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poll interval (minutes) | 20 | 5–1440 | How often to query BigQuery. Each poll is one query covering every probe. |
| BigQuery lookback (hours) | 12 | 1–168 | How far back each poll searches for a probe's latest reading. A probe with nothing in this window keeps its last reading until "Expire after". |
| Warn after (hours) | 12 | 1–168, at most "Mark unavailable after" | Writes one warning to the Home Assistant log when a probe's data gets older than this, and a note when it reports again. |
| Mark unavailable after (hours) | 12 | 1–168 | Makes a probe's sensors unavailable once its latest reading is older than this, counted from when the probe took the reading. |
| Expire after (minutes) | 80 | 5–10080, longer than the poll interval | Also makes a probe's sensors unavailable if its data hasn't come back from a poll for this long, for example during a Google outage. |

### Rotating the key or changing project

To paste a new service-account key or switch GCP projects, open the
integration's menu (Settings → Devices & Services → GeoDrops → ⋮) and choose
**Reconfigure**. Leave the key field blank to keep the current key. Your
probes and settings are kept.

If Google stops accepting the stored key (because it was deleted or revoked,
or its service account was disabled), Home Assistant stops polling and flags
GeoDrops as needing re-authentication on the Devices & Services page. Click
**Reconfigure** on it, then create a new JSON key for the service account and
paste it in to get polling going again. Permission errors (for
example, a missing BigQuery Job User role) don't trigger this. Home Assistant
keeps retrying those, and polling recovers on its own once you fix the role
in GCP.

## Sensors

Each probe becomes one Home Assistant device with 27 sensors:

| Sensor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dominant Moisture | Overall moisture reading (%), the probe's headline value |
| Moisture State | Enum classification of the dominant moisture reading (e.g. dry/moist/wet) |
| Moisture Depth 1 | Moisture (%) at depth sensor 1 |
| Moisture Depth 2 | Moisture (%) at depth sensor 2 |
| Moisture Depth 3 | Moisture (%) at depth sensor 3 |
| Reading Quality Depth 1 | Reading-quality classification at depth sensor 1 |
| Reading Quality Depth 2 | Reading-quality classification at depth sensor 2 |
| Reading Quality Depth 3 | Reading-quality classification at depth sensor 3 |
| Reading Quality | GeoDrops' overall reading-quality classification |
| Probe Health | What the probe needs, from GeoDrops' action codes: OK, Calibrating, Max Moisture Required, Wick Renewal Needed, Hardware Check or Error |
| Next Action Codes | GeoDrops' raw action codes (e.g. `ATT_DW_NEW, DW_M_LOW12`), including ones Probe Health doesn't recognize |
| Max Moisture Calibration | Problem when GeoDrops asks you to run the max-moisture (deep water) test in its app; moisture stays `unknown` until you do (binary sensor) |
| Wick Status | Problem when GeoDrops says the probe's wick needs replacing (binary sensor) |
| Hardware Status | Problem when GeoDrops asks for a hardware check or reports a hardware error (binary sensor) |
| Battery | Probe battery level (%) |
| Battery Status | Problem when GeoDrops flags the battery as poor quality (binary sensor) |
| Battery Voltage | Battery voltage (mV) |
| Signal Strength | The probe's radio signal strength (dBm) |
| Sync Delay | How long the latest reading took to reach GeoDrops' cloud after the probe recorded it (hours; `unknown` when GeoDrops reports an impossible value) |
| Surface Temperature | Soil surface temperature (°C) |
| Temperature Depth 1 | Soil temperature (°C) at depth sensor 1 |
| Temperature Depth 2 | Soil temperature (°C) at depth sensor 2 |
| Temperature Depth 3 | Soil temperature (°C) at depth sensor 3 |
| Avg. 7-Day Sun | 7-day trailing average sun exposure (hours) |
| Last Reading | When the probe took its latest reading (timestamp) |
| Last Detected Watering | When GeoDrops last detected a watering in the probe's readings (timestamp) |
| Watering Confidence | GeoDrops' irrigation confidence for that watering (%) |

GeoDrops marks only the odd reading as showing a watering, so Last Detected
Watering and Watering Confidence keep the last one seen, across restarts and
while the probe is offline. They show `unknown` until a poll finds one. A
watering is seen only if it falls within some poll's lookback window, so one
during a Home Assistant outage longer than the window is missed.

Moisture-related sensors report `unknown` (rather than a misleading value)
while a probe is still in its factory training period and hasn't produced a
calibrated moisture reading yet. Any other value GeoDrops doesn't report
(for example a missing temperature) shows as `unknown`, never as 0. A probe
whose latest reading is older than the configured "mark unavailable after"
threshold (counted from when the probe took it) goes unavailable entirely. Once a probe's data is older than "warn after", a
warning is written to the Home Assistant log (once, until it reports again).

Battery, Battery Status, Battery Voltage, Signal Strength, Sync Delay, Last
Reading, Reading Quality, Reading Quality Depth 1–3, Probe Health, Next Action Codes, Watering Confidence and the Max
Moisture Calibration, Wick Status and Hardware Status sensors are **diagnostic** sensors: they are listed under *Diagnostic* on the device page and left off
auto-generated dashboards. Battery Voltage, Signal Strength, Sync Delay,
Avg. 7-Day Sun, Next Action Codes, Battery Status, Wick Status and Hardware Status are **disabled by default** on newly added probes; enable them from the device page if you want
them. The
Reading Quality sensors stay enabled, because automations and other integrations use
them to decide whether a moisture reading can be trusted.

### States for automations

Moisture State, Probe Health and the Reading Quality sensors show friendly labels in the UI,
but their raw states (what automations, templates and scripts compare
against) are stable keys:

| Sensor | Raw states (UI label) |
| --- | --- |
| Moisture State | `dry` (Dry), `dry_plus` (Dry+), `moist` (Moist), `moist_plus` (Moist+), `wet` (Wet), `wet_plus` (Wet+) |
| Reading Quality, Reading Quality Depth 1–3 | `bad` (Bad), `poor` (Poor), `good` (Good), `training` (Training) |
| Probe Health | `ok` (OK), `calibrating` (Calibrating), `max_moisture_required` (Max Moisture Required), `wick_renewal_needed` (Wick Renewal Needed), `hardware_check` (Hardware Check), `error` (Error) |

A value GeoDrops doesn't classify is Home Assistant's own `unknown`.

Probe Health shows the most urgent of a probe's codes, in the order Error, Hardware
Check, Wick Renewal Needed, Max Moisture Required, Calibrating. Codes it
doesn't recognize, and GeoDrops' notes such as `DW_M_LOW` (one depth reads
lower than the others, even in wet soil), leave it at OK; Next Action Codes
shows them. GeoDrops doesn't document these codes: their meanings come from
comparing them with readings across GeoDrops' probes.

### Automation examples

The examples use a probe named "Front"; replace `front` in the entity ids with
your probe's name.

Only water when the soil is dry, as a condition in an existing irrigation
automation:

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.front_moisture_state
    state: ["dry", "dry_plus"]
```

Get notified when a probe's battery is low:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.front_battery
    below: 20
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "GeoDrops probe Front battery is at {{ states('sensor.front_battery') }}%."
```

Warn about near-freezing soil:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.front_surface_temperature
    below: 2
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "Soil surface at the Front probe is {{ states('sensor.front_surface_temperature') }} °C."
```

## Polling and cost

The integration issues **one BigQuery query per poll**, covering the latest
reading for *all* configured probes at once — it does not issue one query
per device. The default poll interval is **20 minutes**, adjustable in the
integration's options (Settings → Devices & Services → GeoDrops →
Configure → Advanced Options), along with the lookback window
and staleness thresholds. At this query pattern and a typical handful of
probes, usage stays well within BigQuery's free tier.

## Known limitations

- **Readings are only as fresh as GeoDrops' upload.** A probe uploads its
  readings in batches, typically every 2–3 hours, GeoDrops processes them
  hourly, and the integration polls every 20 minutes by default, so a value
  can be a few hours old. Last Reading shows when it was taken.
- **Cloud only.** Readings come from GeoDrops' BigQuery table through Google
  Cloud; there is no local API. If Google, GeoDrops or your internet
  connection is down, sensors keep their last value until "Expire after"
  and then go unavailable.
- **GeoDrops' table is briefly empty about twice a day.** A poll during that
  window finds nothing; each probe keeps its last reading.
- **Probes are added by serial, not discovered.** The table is shared by all
  GeoDrops users, so the integration can't list "your" probes.
- **The first probe is found by searching the last 7 days.** Probes added
  later search the configured lookback window. A probe that hasn't reported
  in that time can't be added until it does.
- **Moisture reads `unknown` during a new probe's training period**, until
  GeoDrops has calibrated it.

## Troubleshooting

**"No readings found for that serial"** when adding a probe. Check the
serial against the GeoDrops app, and that the probe has reported within the
lookback window (12 hours by default; the first probe searches 7 days).

**"Could not query BigQuery"** during setup, or a **"GeoDrops can't query
BigQuery"** repair (Settings → System → Repairs). Google refused the query.
Check that:

1. The project id is your own GCP project, not GeoDrops'.
2. The BigQuery API is enabled on that project.
3. The service account has **BigQuery Job User** on that project.

GeoDrops keeps retrying, and the repair clears itself on the first query that
succeeds.

**GeoDrops asks to re-authenticate.** Google stopped accepting the key. See
[Rotating the key or changing project](#rotating-the-key-or-changing-project).

**A probe's sensors are unavailable.** Its latest reading is older than
"Mark unavailable after", or no reading has come back from a poll for
"Expire after". Check that the probe is reporting in the GeoDrops app. To
see whether Wi-Fi is the cause, enable its Signal Strength sensor and check
its history: a weak signal (around -80 dBm or lower) before the probe went
quiet points to Wi-Fi.

**Moisture sensors show `unknown`.** The probe is still in its training
period, or GeoDrops didn't report that value. Temperatures and battery still
update.

**Reporting a problem.** Enable debug logging (Settings → Devices & services
→ GeoDrops → ⋮ → Enable debug logging), reproduce the problem, then disable
it to download the log. Also download diagnostics from the same menu; they
include each probe's last reading and the last error, with the key and
project id removed. Attach both to an
[issue](https://github.com/ajbaldwin/ha-geodrops-hacs/issues).

## Removing the integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → GeoDrops**, open the ⋮ menu and
   choose **Delete**. This removes every probe with its device and sensors,
   and the stored service-account key.
2. To uninstall the code as well, open **GeoDrops** in HACS, choose ⋮ →
   **Remove**, then restart Home Assistant.
3. Optionally, delete the key in the
   [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (IAM & Admin → Service
   Accounts → your account → Keys), or delete the whole service account.
   Home Assistant no longer holds the key, but the key itself stays valid
   until you delete it.

To remove a single probe instead, use **Configure → Remove a probe**.
